 * Dear Facebook and React Developers,
 *
 * Thanks for this fascinating library, React.js. With this such a famous tool,
 * it's a shame to see that you cannot load image dynamically through path as
 * a string.
 *
 * Hence I have created this file to help us load all images at a place, so it
 * can be used in other React components. With that being said, this class is
 * totally unnecessary if React.js has already correctly implemented the dynamic
 * loading for media files.
 *
 * Best,
 * Jen-Chieh Shen
